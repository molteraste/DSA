This program uses graphs, hash tables, heaps and linked lists in order to provide a bushfire monitoring program.
The DSAGraph.java, DSAHeap.java, DSAHashTable.java, DSALinkedList.java files allows implementation of a graph,
heap, hash table and a linked list respectively. The DSAGraph.java file uses a linked list through DSALinkedList.java
to keep track of the vertices and edges of a graph while the Main.java file uses a linked list for a list of locations
that is needed for the itinerary from Task 6 in the assignment. The Main.java file acted as a test harness for all the
classes.

The .txt files are the test data; the location.txt and UAVdata.txt files are the given files for the assignment, while
the .txt files that have similar names but with "Smaller" or "Larger" inside are slightly modified versions of the
given .txt files for testing with smaller and larger test data.

Whenever the program asks for an input, type the input desired and press the "Enter" button after each input. The
program, when initiated, asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 3 inclusive for the test data desired.
After the test data is chosen the program initialises its graph, hash table and heaps according to the data in the
.txt files and opens a menu from which each task from the assignment can be executed. Choosing an option and entering
all the information needed for each option will execute the displayed task and will then return back to the menu for
more testing.
